<div class="Intro">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Hello there! I'm Sol. it's nice to meet you! First, a little about me. I wear a lot of different hats. I love art, drawing, gaming, writing, and coding of all kinds. I love learning and I believe that education and knowledge is the key to unlocking the potential of a person and the most important way to make this world a little bit better.</p>
</div>

<div class="Artist">
	<h2>The Artist</h2>

	<p>I started drawing around 2007. Of all the tricks in my repitoire, it is by far my weakest talent. Despite that, I enjoy sketching on a quiet evening and when the moon is full and provides soft light. I draw inspiration from everything I see around me and the characters I dream up in my worlds when I write.</p>
</div>

<div class="Gamer">
	<h2>The Gamer</h2>

	<p>So, I've had a...habit, let's call it that, of gaming since I was young. My first experience was when my neighbor gave me his Gameboy. The first game I played was Tetris. Since then, I have played everything from FPS games, to sim games such as Euro Truck Sim 2, Train Sim world, and everything and anything in between.</p>
</div>

<div class="Writer">
	<h2>The Writer</h2>

	<p>I've written a few stories and novels over the years. I've written in a wide range of genres, from science fiction to fantasy. I've done a lot of short stories as well, I work on commission when possible but I also write for fun. I have always been able to visualize the worlds I create vividly and the characters that exist in them. Of all my talents, writing is by far the one I love most and pride myself on.</p>
</div>

<div class="Musician">
	<h2>The Musician</h2>

	<p>One of the talents I don't talk about often, I actually do play an instrument, I tried the violin and trumpet once. Neither of them were for me, but my grandmother had an old keyboard, and when I first touched the keys I fell in love with the sound of the piano, since then, I learned to play by ear and built on the foundations of those first notes.</p>
</div>

<div class="Photographer">
	<h2>The Photographer</h2>

	<p>While I've always liked photography, I was never particularly good at it. Where my art skills lack because I lack the hand control, my photography skill suffers because I lack the eye for what makes a good photo. But, I have been improving and with the purchase of a decent tripod last year, I was able to start improving my favorite subject to photograph, the night sky.</p>
