I'm doing my best to create a website for myself, this will be where I upload it, feedback is appreciated and comments are welcome within reason and courtesy, with some exception. 

Photos:
So all photos I use for backgrounds or Containers or anything like that are all taken BY me, they are my work and they are my property. However, I am open to allowing their use.
I do photography to share what I love with the world in hopes someone can appreciate the things I see as much as I do, so if you see any photos on my site which you'd like to use, either
in gallery or as backgrounds or wherever else, please just ask before you use them, I greatly appreciate it. 

I plan to update the site at least once or twice weekly as my schedule allows so please understand this is no where near a finished polished thing, this is gonna be barebones for a little while
while I go through classes, cert prep, and real life issues. Again, much appreciated.

Sol M.
